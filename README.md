Overview
This dashboard provides a comparative analysis of different forecast sources over time, specifically focusing on how the Actuals, Final, Finance, and Marketing forecasts align with each other on a monthly basis. The visualization offers insights into the variations and trends among these forecast sources, helping users understand discrepancies and patterns in forecasting across various departments.

Key Features
Interactive Forecast Source Selection:

The dashboard allows users to filter and focus on specific forecast sources using the buttons at the top (e.g., Actuals, Final, Finance, Marketing, Sales). This feature enables users to isolate and analyze individual data streams or compare multiple sources simultaneously.
Monthly Trend Analysis:

The main graph illustrates the monthly trend of the forecasts across the selected sources. Each line represents a different forecast source, with distinct colors and styles (e.g., solid, dashed, dotted) for easy differentiation.
Quarterly Segmentation:

The timeline on the x-axis is segmented by quarters (Q1, Q2, etc.), allowing users to observe the performance and forecast accuracy within specific fiscal quarters, spanning from January 2020 to December 2021.
Historical Forecast Toggle:

A toggle button ("Show/Hide") on the right allows users to display or hide historical forecast data. This feature is useful for comparing current forecasts with past performance, providing a deeper context for the analysis.
Legends and Color-Coding:

The legends beside the graph clearly label the forecast sources, with each one color-coded (e.g., Finance in blue, Marketing in purple) to match the corresponding lines on the graph.
Usage
This dashboard is designed to assist business analysts, financial planners, and department heads in making informed decisions by providing a clear visual representation of forecast data. It can be used in performance reviews, strategy meetings, or for ongoing monitoring of forecasting accuracy and consistency across departments.
